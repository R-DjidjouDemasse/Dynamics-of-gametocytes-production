# 'Understanding dynamics of P. falciparum gametocytes production: Insights from an age-structured model' by Ramsès Djidjou-Demasse, Arnaud Ducrot, Nicole Mideo, Gaëtan Texier (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03030234)
The aim of this dataverse is to provide the code used for the numerical integration of the model described in “Understanding dynamics of P. falciparum gametocytes production: Insights from an age-structured model” by Ramsès Djidjou-Demasse, Arnaud Ducrot, Nicole Mideo, Gaëtan Texier (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03030234).
Reproducibility of the main figures 3, 4 and 5.
The file “Patient_Data.xlsx” is a given data set.
The script “ODE_optimi.m” is the main function integrating the ODE model.  
Running "MainFigures.m" with MatLab produced the main figures 3, 4 and 5 of the paper (for a given patient data “Patient_Data.xlsx”). Note that “MainFigures.m” calls the main function “ODE_optimi.m”
